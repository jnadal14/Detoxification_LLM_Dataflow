# COLX 565 Project – Agentic Detoxification Dataflow

## Group Repository: Tim and Jacob

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for our COLX 565 Final project focused on **agentic workflows for text sentiment analysis and detoxification**. The goal of this project is to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of an agentic dataflow approach to reduce toxicity in text while preserving meaning and sentiment.

## Notebooks

- **`agentic_workflow.ipynb`**  
  Contains scripts to load and process the datasets. Employs UBC-NLP/toucan-base for text translation from African languages to English and ibm-granite/granite-3.2-2b-instruct for sentiment/toxicity classification, explanation generation, and detoxification.

- **`Annotation_Statstics_notebook.ipynb`**  
  Explores the annotated dataset using summary statistics and visualizations.

## Dataset

- `Detoxification Annotations.csv`: Contains annotated sentences along with toxicity/sentiment labels and annotator agreement.
- `multilingual-sentiment-test-solutions.csv`: Ground-truth data for evaluating multilingual sentiment analysis.
- `toxic-test-solutions.csv`: Ground-truth data for evaluating toxicity classification accuracy.

## Results

- `sentiment_results.csv`: Sentences from multilingual-sentiment-test-solutions.csv along with their id, target class label, predicted class label ("positive", "mixed" or "neutral"), and explanation (generated by the LLM). 
- `toxicity_results.csv`: Sentences from toxic-test-solutions.csv along with their id, target class label, predicted class label ("Toxic" or "non-toxic"), and an explanation (generated by the LLM).
